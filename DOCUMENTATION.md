## 1. Getting Started

To get started with EvergladePHP, please refer to the README.md file in the project repository.

## 2. Routing

EvergladePHP provides a simple and flexible routing system for mapping URLs to controller actions. Routes can be defined using a variety of methods, including static routes, dynamic routes, and resource routes.

For more information on routing, see [Routing](#routing).

## 3. Controllers

Controllers in EvergladePHP are responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests, processing data, and returning responses to the client. Controllers can be defined using classes that extend the base controller class provided by the framework.

For more information on controllers, see [Controllers](#controllers).

## 4. Models

Models in EvergladePHP are used to interact with the database and represent data entities in the application. Models can be created using the built-in ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) provided by the framework.

For more information on models, see [Models](#models).

## 5. Views

Views in EvergladePHP are responsible for generating HTML markup and rendering content to the client's browser. Views can be created using template files that contain a mixture of HTML and placeholders for dynamic content.

For more information on views, see [Views](#views).

## 6. Middleware

Middleware in EvergladePHP provides a convenient way to preprocess HTTP requests before they reach the controller. Middleware components can perform tasks such as authentication, authorization, logging, and more.

For more information on middleware, see [Middleware](#middleware).

## 7. Error Handling

EvergladePHP includes comprehensive error handling capabilities to help developers diagnose and troubleshoot issues in their applications. Error handling can be customized to display informative error messages and log errors to files or databases.

For more information on error handling, see [Error Handling](#error-handling).

## 8. Component Handling

EvergladePHP supports modular architecture with support for reusable components, allowing developers to extend the functionality of their applications easily. Components can be shared across projects or distributed as standalone packages.

For more information on component handling, see [Component Handling](#component-handling).

## 9. Session Management

EvergladePHP provides utilities for managing user sessions and handling authentication. Session management features include setting session variables, retrieving session data, and enforcing user authentication.

For more information on session management, see [Session Management](#session-management).

## 10. Database Migrations

EvergladePHP comes with a built-in database migration system that simplifies the process of managing database schemas and versioning. With migrations, developers can easily create, update, and rollback database schema changes in a controlled and repeatable manner.

For more information on database migrations, see [Database Migrations](#database-migrations).

## 11. Example Application

EvergladePHP comes with an example application—a mini cinema application—to demonstrate real-world usage and facilitate developer onboarding.
